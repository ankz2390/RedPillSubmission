Version: 1.0

Tge submission contrains a single HTML file. I have used ajax to fetch data from the JSON file on the server. I was unable to take out the time to code for the second problem about Zulu time. However I believe I have effectively calculated the other two parameters. The ajax just doesn't fetch data and I am not sure why. I am guessing its a small error. Thanks for looking through my code!
